# Sparta_Global_Calculator

## The Aim
The aim for this work was to build on my previous calculator, using functions in order to manipulate the data. This meant that the code was mroe testable and returned the result rather than just printing it to the consolde. Another change was that the values were inputted into the calculator through the use of buttons rather than a prompt window.
